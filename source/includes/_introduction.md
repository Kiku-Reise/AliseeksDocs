# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Aliseeks API allows interaction with two data sources.

* **Real-Time Data** - Direct request to AliExpress to retrieve live data.

* **Non Real-Time Data** - Comes from Aliseek's periodically updated data source.

Aliseeks API provides online retail search, product details with variations, and freight information. We also are working
on providing Ordering and Shipment Tracking. You can view request and response samples of each API operation.

**We are no longer accepting new integrations at this time.**
